    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>When I was 18, I was immersed in a film that inspired me to reflect on my own identity as a Tamil man: Black Panther. The powerful representation of the Black community in the film left me in awe and motivated me to explore my own cultural roots, igniting a passion that I still carry today.</p>
    
    <p>Growing up, I often felt that our community was small and marginalized, like we were invisible in the larger narrative. But as I’ve matured, I've discovered the incredible stories and achievements of Tamils around the world, which fill me with pride. By presenting the Tamil Community Center as the backdrop, this documentary delves into the complexities of Tamil identity while celebrating the vibrant tapestry of our culture and heritage.</p>
    
    <p>Through this film, I hope to share our journey with the world, showcasing the richness of Tamil culture and fostering a deeper understanding of who we are as a community, instilling a sense of awe and respect within our own community, just as Black Panther did for me.</p>
